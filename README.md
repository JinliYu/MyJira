## Welcome to MyJira

MyJira is a web based application built on Rails. Its purpose is to realize an online version of kanban board, as a team project tracking tool. Our goals are efficiency and convenience.

We hypothesized that, with our application, team members would collaborate more efficiently with minimal extra work for updating the project status to be done. And furthermore, by tracking card status in the board and integrating with GitHub, our app can render visualizations of individual contributions to the project for statistical analysis. Ultimately, we hope this app will help students work on team projects at school and therefore improve the quality of student learning.
